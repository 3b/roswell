# Roswell - Common Lisp environment setup Utility.

This software is alpha-quality. Nothing stable, reliable.

## Description
Installing Common Lisp and setting up everything just work is still difficult and you have to learn some tips.

## Why we named roswell?
From &lsquo;[made with secret alien technology](http://www.lisperati.com/logo.html)&rsquo;.

I felt making it easier to use Lisp for people is a kind of making opportunity for humanbeings to mingle with alien technology. I recall &lsquo;roswell incident&rsquo; by the concept. I'm not sure what you feel.

## Installation

    $ sh bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

## How to use
### setting up
First of all, you have to install Lisp environment. You can install a binary version of SBCL and Quicklisp from internet by these commands:

    $ ros setup

### command help
After the installation type ros and you'll get some information by
