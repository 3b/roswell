This software is alpha-quality. nothing stable,reliable.

## Description
installing Common Lisp and setting up everything just work is still difficult and you have to learn some tips.

## Why we named roswell?
from 'made with secret alien technology'(http://www.lisperati.com/logo.html)
I felt making it easier to use lisp for people is a kind of making opportunity for humanbeings to mingle with
alien technology.I recall 'roswell incident' by the concept.I'm not sure what you feel.
