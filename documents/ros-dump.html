<h1>name</h1>
<p>ros-dump - make a dumped image of a roswell script</p>
<h1>synopsis</h1>
<p><strong>ros [options] dump</strong> <em>type</em> args...</p>
<p>Where the types of subcommands are one of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd><p>Create a dump image.</p>
</dd>
<dt>executable</dt>
<dd><p>Create an executable.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>description</h1>
<code>ros-dump</code> creates a dumped lisp image of the state after processing all
<p>arguments passed.</p>
Specifing <code>output</code> results in just an image which results in the same lisp
state when loading the image. The image can be loaded by <code>ros -m IMAGE</code>. Standard roswell subcommands and additional arguments to the script
are also available, for example <code>ros run</code> to resume with a repl, or
<p><code>--restart FUNC</code> to call a specific function, leaving some flexibility.</p>
In contrast, when a script is dumped with <code>executable</code>, the dumped image
<p>becomes an self-contained executable binary which implies <code>--restart main</code>.</p>
In both cases, the global environment (e.g. global binding to a special
variable such as <code>*package*</code>) is the environment which was effective when
<p>the script was dumped.</p>
There might be a limitation regarding this feature depending on the lisp
implementation roswell is configured to use at the time of building. Also,
the dumped image is not compatible between the different implementations
<p>and even between the same implementations with different versions.</p>
